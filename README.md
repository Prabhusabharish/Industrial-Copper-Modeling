**INDUSTRIAL COPPER MODELING**

**Project Overview**
This project involves building machine learning models for the industrial copper industry. The goal is to address challenges related to sales and pricing data, including skewness, noisy data, and lead classification. Two main models are developed:

  ✔ Regression Model : Predicts the continuous variable 'Selling_Price.'

  ✔	Classification Model : Classifies leads as either 'WON' or 'LOST.'

Additionally, a Streamlit web application is created for interactive predictions.

**Project Structure**

**Data Exploration and Preprocessing**

**Data Understanding** :

  ✔	Identifying variable types (continuous, categorical).

  ✔	Treating rubbish values in 'Material_Reference.'

  ✔	 Converting reference columns to categorical variables.

  ✔	Creating datetime columns.

**Data Preprocessing** :
  ✔	Handling missing values.

  ✔	Treating outliers using IQR or Isolation Forest.

  ✔	Handling skewness with appropriate transformations.

  ✔	Encoding categorical variables.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

  ✔	Visualizing outliers and skewness before and after treatment using Seaborn plots.

**Feature Engineering**

  ✔	Creating new features if applicable.
  
  ✔	Dropping highly correlated columns.

**Model Building and Evaluation**

  ✔	Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

  ✔	Training and evaluating classification models.

  ✔	Optimizing model hyperparameters using Grid Search.

  ✔	Training and evaluating regression models.

**Model GUI (Streamlit)**

  ✔	Using the Streamlit module to create an interactive page.

  ✔	Inputting values for each column to get Selling_Price predictions or lead Status (Won/Lost).

**Project Learning Outcomes**

1. Proficiency in Python programming and data analysis libraries.

2. Experience in data preprocessing techniques.

3. Understanding and visualizing data through EDA techniques.

4. Building and optimizing machine learning models for classification and regression.

5. Creating a web application using Streamlit.

6. Gaining domain-specific knowledge in the manufacturing industry.

**Project Evaluation Metrics**

  ✔	Code should be modular, maintainable, and portable.

  ✔	Codebase should be maintained on GitHub (public repository).

  ✔	Include a proper README file explaining project development.

  ✔	Follow Python coding standards (PEP 8).
